        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</li>
          <li>Is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</li>
          <li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page and consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content</li>
          <li>lang="en" tells the browser the language for the webpage (English).</li>
          <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The "charset" element sets our character encoding.</li>
          <li>The "http-equiv" element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The "viewport" element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
          <li>The "div" element creates a division in the page.</li>
          <li>The "span" element creates an inline division.</li>
          <li>The "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", and "h6" elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>The "ul", "ol", and "li" elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>
          <li>The "img" element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage and it can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The "br" element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content. </li>
          <li>the "a" element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages</li>
          <li>The "href" attribute points to the URL for the link</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>Use * to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code: combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>"text-align" is a positioning property. This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The "img" selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>The ls command shows the list of files and directories on the computer</li>
          <li>The cd command allows us to change directories.</li>
          <li>The pwd command, which is short for "print working directory," will print out the directory that we are currently in to the terminal. </li>
          <li>The cd .. will allow us to navigate backwards one directory at a time.</li>
          <li>To create a directory, we can use the mkdir command.</li>
          <li>We use the add -A command to commit all files in the working branch.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>The topics "variable" contains a string, all strings are surrounded by quotation marks *.</li>
          <li>We can use the "console.log" method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. </li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
